JSONPath is a syntax, originally based on the XML "XPath" design,
which selects fields and values from a JSON document.  It is
used in a variety of applications which rely on JSON message
formats.

JSONPath was originally described by Stefan Goessner [1] but has
never had an official specification of any kind, and the 39+
implementations, while mostly compatible, differ in certain
behaviors.

The WG will develop a standards-track JSONPath specification, with the
primary goal of capturing the common semantics of existing
implementations and, where there are differences, choosing
semantics with the goal of causing the least disruption among
JSONPath users.

The latter goal rules out the alternatives of adopting standards such
as RFC 6901 JSON Pointer (functionally poorer than JSONPath) or
JMESPath (functionally richer than, but incompatible with, JSONPath).
