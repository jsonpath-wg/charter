JSONPath is a syntax, originally based on the XML "XPath" design,
which selects fields and values from a JSON document.  It is
used in a variety of applications which rely on JSON message
formats.

JSONPath was originally described by Stefan Goessner [1] but has
never had an official specification of any kind, and the 39+
implementations, while mostly compatible, differ in certain
behaviors.

Other, incompatible approaches exist, such as RFC 6901 JSON Pointer
(single position, very limited selectors) or JMESPath (rich, fully
specified), but have not succeeded in supplanting JSONPath.
These approaches are out of scope for the WG, except that it may be
useful to describe the mapping between subsets of JSON Pointer and
JSONPath.

The WG will develop a standards-track JSONPath specification, with the
primary goal of capturing the common semantics of existing
implementations and, where there are differences, choosing
semantics with the goal of causing the least disruption among
JSONPath users.
